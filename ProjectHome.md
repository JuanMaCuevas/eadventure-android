**IMPORTANT NOTICE**

---

_The official port of the eAdventure Engine 1.X for Android has moved to our organization in GitHub: https://github.com/e-ucm/eadventure-legacy-android. From now on, you can download it from there._

Anyway, please take into account that this project is discontinued. We are not allocating any resources to further develop the eAdventure 1.X, neither on Android or Desktop. This doesn't mean the eAdventure project is dead, actually it is very active since we are redoing the platform in what is known as the eAdventure 2.0 project, which will be multiplatform. You can check its progress also on GitHub: https://github.com/e-ucm/ead_---_

The `<e-adventure`> Engine for Android project aims to integrate and optimize the `<e-adventure`> graphics engine on the Android platform. We are currently not supporting this project.
